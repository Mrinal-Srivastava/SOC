Vulnerabilities exploited: BlackCat ransomware has been observed to have the knowledge to exploit these five vulnerabilities: 

CVE-2016-0099 (High)
    => A vulnerability that affects the Secondary Logon Service in Microsoft Windows. This vulnerability allows local users to gain privileges through a crafted application.
    => The Secondary Logon Service in Microsoft Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, Windows RT 8.1, and Windows 10 Gold and 1511            does not properly process request handles, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted application, aka "Secondary Logon Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability."

CVE-2019-7481 (High)
    =>  Vulnerability in SonicWall SMA100 allow unauthenticated user to gain read-only access to unauthorized resources. This vulnerablity impacted SMA100 version 9.0.0.3 and earlier.
                > SonicWall a cybersecurity company that sells internet appliances for content control and network security. SonicWall products include firewalls and wireless security access points

CVE-2021-31207 (High)
    => A Microsoft Exchange Server security feature bypass vulnerability. It allows a threat actor to write files to disk by abusing a feature of the Exchange PowerShell backend.

CVE-2021-34473 (Critical)
    => A Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. It's a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability that allows an attacker to force a vulnerable server to make requests to internal resources. The attacker doesn't need authentication because the requests are made by the endpoints to the backend servers. 

CVE-2021-34523 (Critical)
    => A privilege escalation vulnerability that affects Microsoft Exchange PowerShell. It's also a Microsoft Exchange Remote Code Execution vulnerability.
    => The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Exchange Server and escalate their privileges, potentially allowing them to take full control of the server. This can be done by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the Exchange Server.

# Recommended Mitigations:
=> Periodicaly Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new or unrecognized user accounts
=> Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, secure location (e.g., hard drive, storage device, the cloud). 
=> Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as updates/patchesare released.
=> Use multifactor authentication where possible. 
=> Disable unused remote access/Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports and monitor remote access/RDP logs.
=> Implement RBAC (Role-based access control ) and Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with least privilege in mind.
=> Install and regularly update antivirus and anti-malware software on all hosts. 
=> Disable hyperlinks in received emails.
